# 🔁 Recursion Practice in Java

A collection of recursive function implementations written in Java to practice classic algorithmic patterns and deepen understanding of recursion.

## 📘 Topics Covered

- Factorials
- Fibonacci sequence
- Sum of digits
- Power function
- Array recursion

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Open `Recursion.java` in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse)
2. Run each method and test its output
3. Modify or add more recursive functions to keep practicing!

## 💡 Why Recursion?

Recursion is a foundational skill in problem solving and is often tested in coding interviews and algorithm courses. This project was built to explore and master it through hands-on examples.
